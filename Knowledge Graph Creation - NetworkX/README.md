# Knowledge Graph Creation with NetworkX | Python Tutorial

**Video Tutorial:** https://youtu.be/o5USzpzKm6o

# Project Information

In this video, we explore how to create a knowledge graph using NetworkX in Python. We cover the fundamentals of graph-based data representation, building nodes and edges, and visualizing relationships within a dataset. By leveraging NetworkX, we demonstrate how to structure and analyze complex interconnected data efficiently, making it useful for applications in natural language processing, recommendation systems, and knowledge representation.
